I will be dividing this series of tutorials into five parts:

    Part 1: Booting Up R
    Part 2: The Gender-Class Model
    Part 3: Decision Trees
    Part 4: Feature Engineering
    Part 5: Random Forests

This repository contains all code used in the five part tutorial that can be found here:

If you have any questions about these lessons, Iâ€™d encourage you to post them to the Kaggle forums:

where many others may have already come across the issue before and can jump in to help you out.

If you notice any bugs or typos, or have any suggestions on making the tutorial easier to follow,
please send me a direct message through any of ...
